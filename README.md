# spritely

This is an implementation of [spritely-editor](https://github.com/dfirebaugh/spritely-editor) written in golang.

Why? Go is pretty sweet. Also, I'm learning about the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).


## Demo
[in browser demo](https://dfirebaugh.github.io/spritely/)

## running the app
[download go](https://go.dev/dl/)

`go run ./cmd/main`
